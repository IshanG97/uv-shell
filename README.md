# uv-shell
The devs at [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) did an amazing job, so I wanted to make it even faster to setup!

1. Save `uv-shell` to `~/.uv-shell`
2. Add the code in `uv-profile` to your profile e.g. `.profile`, `.zshrc`
3. Have fun! Example usage:
   
`uvshell`     # Activates or creates venv

`pip install fastapi`  # Install some packages

`uvfreeze`    # Freeze them to pyproject.toml
